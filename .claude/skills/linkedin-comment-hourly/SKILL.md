# LinkedIn Comment Hourly

Thin orchestrator. Three sub-agents do the heavy work — `gather-feed` (scrape + classify), `prep-refs` (refresh the local reference cache once), and `draft` (fan out in parallel, one per post) — this skill glues them and posts to Slack.

## Constants

| Resource | ID / Path |
|---|---|
| Comments file | `./linkedin-compain/comments.json` (single JSON array — every post, drafted or filtered, is one object) |
| Interests file | `.claude/skills/linkedin-comment-hourly/interests.md` |
| Reference cache | `$HOME/.cache/linkedin-ai-refs` (local mirror of ICP / True BDD / Posted / Transcripts; **outside the worktree** so `git clean -fd` can't wipe it) |
| Slack channel | `C0BF606R4N7` (https://spdfn.slack.com/archives/C0BF606R4N7) |
| Target posts per fire | `5` |

`comments.json` is the single source of truth **and** the cross-fire seen-set. Each element is one post: drafted posts carry `variants` + Slack timestamps; filtered posts (`off-topic` / `already-commented`) carry a `reason` and empty `variants`. Agent 1 appends the filtered entries; you (the orchestrator) append the drafted ones. Never hand-write JSON — always mutate the array with `jq`.

## Flow

### Step 1 — Gather 5 posts from the home feed

Spawn `linkedin-comment-hourly-gather-feed` via the Agent tool. Its prompt body:

```
COMMENTS_FILE=./linkedin-compain/comments.json
TARGET_COUNT=5
MAX_SCROLL_ITERATIONS=80
INTERESTS_FILE=.claude/skills/linkedin-comment-hourly/interests.md
```

Parse the KEY=VALUE return. Expected keys: `POSTS_FOUND`, `POSTS_OFF_TOPIC`, `POSTS_ALREADY_COMMENTED`, `POSTS_REPOSTS_SKIPPED`, `POSTS_PROMOTED_SKIPPED`, `SCROLL_ITERATIONS`, `FEED_EXHAUSTED`, and `POST_<i>_KEY`, `POST_<i>_URN`, `POST_<i>_URL`, `POST_<i>_AUTHOR_URL`, `POST_<i>_AUTHOR`, `POST_<i>_HEADLINE`, `POST_<i>_TIME_AGO`, `POST_<i>_TEXT_B64` for i = 1..`POSTS_FOUND`. `POST_<i>_URL` is the **post permalink** (`https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/<urn>/`) or `-` when no URN could be recovered; `POST_<i>_AUTHOR_URL` is the **author profile link**. `POST_<i>_URN` is `-` when not extractable even after the copy-link recovery pass (LinkedIn strips URNs from the home feed DOM as of 2026-07); `POST_<i>_KEY` is the synthetic `<author-slug>-<body-hash8>` identifier. Agent 1 has already appended the off-topic / already-commented posts to `comments.json`; the `POST_<i>_*` entries it returns are the relevant ones still needing drafts.

If `POSTS_FOUND=0` (or the agent returns `ERROR=<...>`), emit the failure line, do NOT spawn Step 1.5 / Step 2, and stop. The shell driver's `git diff --quiet` check skips the commit.

### Step 1.5 — Refresh the local reference cache

Spawn `linkedin-comment-hourly-prep-refs` via the Agent tool (once, before any drafting). Its prompt body:

```
REF_CACHE=$HOME/.cache/linkedin-ai-refs
POSTED_FOLDER=1J_c1cWZ_kzPd_WrKsO_5fh-ud68seGOy
TRANSCRIPTS_FOLDER=13edYDnaAbHJN28gr9p-WK5dz-Qhi1th7
ICP_DOC=145BAhw3s8MYv7zozKTgP4uJ2is-TUQgpsWzWvgm28VE
TRUE_BDD_DOC=1Fn6-ElFqHHyGFg500InkB85MKpCzPhZT5N3GLVWdMYc
```

This agent does the fire's only Google Drive reads — it downloads the four reference sources into the local cache **once** (re-fetching only the docs whose Drive modified-date changed). Parse its return for `REF_CACHE` (and the individual paths); you pass `REF_CACHE` to every draft agent so drafting reads local files and needs zero GDrive access. If it returns `ERROR=<...>`, still proceed — the draft agents degrade gracefully on a missing cache file — but note it in the final report.

### Step 2 — Draft ALL posts in PARALLEL, then write + Slack

Because drafting now reads only the local `REF_CACHE` (no shared MCP), the draft agents are independent and **must be launched concurrently**.

**2a. Fan out — spawn every draft agent in a single message.** For all `POSTS_FOUND` posts at once, issue one message containing one `linkedin-comment-hourly-draft` Agent call per post (this runs them in parallel). Each call's prompt body:

```
POST_KEY=<synthetic key from Agent 1>
POST_URN=<urn or "-">
POST_URL=<POST_<i>_AUTHOR_URL — author profile url or "-">
POST_AUTHOR=<author_name>
POST_HEADLINE=<author_headline>
POST_TEXT_B64=<base64 post text>
REF_CACHE=<REF_CACHE from Step 1.5>
```

Collect all returns. For any that returned `ERROR=<...>`, drop that post (note it in the report) and keep the rest.

**2b. Write + Slack — sequentially, once all drafts are back.** Iterate the successful results **one at a time** (Slack posting and the `comments.json` read-modify-write must not interleave). For each post:

1. Decode each variant's `VARIANT_<i>_COMMENT_B64` (via `base64 -d` — never decode by hand). The entry is keyed by the synthetic key from Agent 1 (`<author-slug>-<body-hash8>`), not the URN, because the home feed strips URNs.

2. **Append a `drafted` entry** to `./linkedin-compain/comments.json`. Build the object with `jq -n` (decode the base64 comments into `--arg` values so newlines/quotes are safe), then append with `jq '. + [$e]'` — same read-modify-write discipline Agent 1 uses. The entry shape:

   ```json
   {
     "key": "<POST_KEY>",
     "urn": "<urn or null>",
     "post_url": "<post permalink https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/<urn>/ — from POST_<i>_URL, or null when no URN>",
     "author_url": "<author profile url — from POST_<i>_AUTHOR_URL, or null>",
     "author_name": "<name>",
     "author_headline": "<headline>",
     "time_ago": "<e.g. 2d or null>",
     "post_text": "<decoded text>",
     "scraped_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC now>",
     "disposition": "drafted",
     "reason": null,
     "variants": [
       { "strategy_label": "<label>", "comment": "<decoded comment>", "rationale": "<one line>" }
     ],
     "slack_summary": null,
     "slack_ts": null,
     "slack_thread": {
       "post_reply_ts": null,
       "draft_reply_ts": []
     },
     "slack_error": null
   }
   ```

   The `drafted` entry shares the exact field set as Agent 1's filtered entries — only `disposition`, `reason`, and `variants` differ — so the array stays uniform.

4. **Post a compact summary to the main channel**, then thread the details underneath. First compose a one-line summary of the post yourself (what is this post about? — ≤150 chars, plain English, no marketing words). Then:

   **4a. Main-channel message** — `mcp__claude_ai_Slack_Bot__postMessage` with `channel_id=C0BF606R4N7`, body:

   ```
   📌 *<author_name>* — <author_headline>
   👤 <author_url>
   _<one-line summary of the post>_
   ```

   Capture the returned `ts` — call it `parent_ts`. Store it in the JSON as `slack_ts`.

   **4b. Thread reply — the post itself** — `mcp__claude_ai_Slack_Bot__replyInThread` (or `postMessage` with `thread_ts=parent_ts`). Include **both** links — the post permalink and the author profile — so a reader can open the post directly. Body:

   ```
   🔗 Post: <post_url, or "home-feed card — no stable permalink" when post_url is null>
   👤 Author: <author_url>

   > <full post_text — no truncation; wrap in a quote block>
   ```

   `post_url` is the permalink from `POST_<i>_URL` (present for posts where the URN was recovered; null otherwise). `author_url` comes from `POST_<i>_AUTHOR_URL` and is essentially always present. Never collapse the two into one line — the author profile is not a substitute for the post link.

   **4c. Thread reply — one message per draft** — for each variant, post a separate thread reply:

   ```
   *Draft <i> — <strategy_label>*
   <comment text>
   _Rationale: <one line>_
   ```

5. Capture each reply's `ts` and record them by **updating this post's entry in `comments.json`** (match on `.key == "<POST_KEY>"`), e.g.:

   ```bash
   tmp=$(mktemp)
   jq --arg k "<POST_KEY>" --arg summary "<one-line summary>" \
      --arg ts "<parent_ts>" --arg pr "<ts of 4b>" \
      --argjson drafts '["<ts draft1>","<ts draft2>", ...]' \
      '(.[] | select(.key==$k)) |= (.slack_summary=$summary | .slack_ts=$ts
         | .slack_thread.post_reply_ts=$pr | .slack_thread.draft_reply_ts=$drafts)' \
      ./linkedin-compain/comments.json > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" ./linkedin-compain/comments.json
   ```

   On any failure: update the same entry's `slack_error` to a one-line message (`(.[] | select(.key==$k)).slack_error=$msg`). Continue with the next post.

### Step 3 — Emit the final report

```
### LinkedIn Comment Ideas — <ISO 8601 UTC now>
Posts drafted:            <n> / 5
Off-topic skipped:        <POSTS_OFF_TOPIC>
Already-commented skipped: <POSTS_ALREADY_COMMENTED>
Reposts skipped:          <POSTS_REPOSTS_SKIPPED>
Promoted skipped:         <POSTS_PROMOTED_SKIPPED>
Feed exhausted:           <FEED_EXHAUSTED>
Slack messages posted:    <n>
Slack failures:           <n>
```

## What you must not do

- Do **not** open Playwright yourself — that lives inside Agent 1's tool allowlist. If Agent 1 fails, do not fall back to a direct scrape.
- Do **not** run the linkedin-comment-ideas skill directly for a post. Delegating to the draft agent keeps the reference reads out of your context.
- Do **not** run the draft agents sequentially — they read only the local `REF_CACHE` (no shared MCP), so launch them **all in one message** (Step 2a). Sequential drafting is the old, slow behavior.
- Do **not**, however, interleave the **Slack posts or the `comments.json` writes** — those stay strictly sequential (Step 2b) to avoid a read-modify-write race on the single file.
- Do **not** skip Step 1.5 (prep-refs) — without the local cache, the draft agents have no reference material (they have no GDrive tools).
- Do **not** invent or edit the interest filter here. If the filter needs tuning, edit `interests.md`.
- Do **not** perform any git operations — the shell driver `run-hourly.sh` handles branching, committing, and auto-merging.
